There are three main threads of development in this source tree.

- A package of R functions for analysis of RNA-SEQ and RNA-RIB
  profiles.The R programs at the top level and in the R/ subdirectory
  comprise

- An application in 'shiny/' to make the analysis more accessible by
embedding it in a Shiny app.  Shiny is an R package that makes
interactive applications available in web browsers.

- The Python script under python that will read a series of BAM file
and a feature annotation file (in GTF format) and produces a text file
containing read depths across the selected features.  The output of
this script is a table that can be read into the supplied R functions
for analysis.


The qarp package can be loaded with,

    R CMD INSTALL --build qarp_0.1-1.tar.gz


In addition to the qarp package, there is an example usage script, example.R.
This script can be sourced into an R interactive session.  The output from
such a session is shown below.
