There are three main threads of development in this source tree.

1. The R programs at the top level and in the R/ subdirectory comprise
a set of functions and example usage for the qualitative assessment of
RNA-SEQ profiles.

2. The files under inst/shiny are an attempt to make the analysis more
accessible by embedding it in a Shiny app.  Shiny is an R package that
makes interactive applications available in web browsers.

3. The Python script under inst/python is a script that will read a
series of BAM file and a feature annotation file (in GTF format) and
will produce a text file containing read depths across the selected
features.  The output of this script can be read into the supplied R
functions for analysis.
