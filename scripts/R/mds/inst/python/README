bam2depth.py will calculate read depths across genes for alignments in multiple BAM files.

Usage - 
      python bam2depth.py [-g gene] <annotation.gtf> <bamfile.bam. [<bamfile2.bam> <bamfile3.bam> ...]

Prerequisites - 

    bam2depth.py calls 'samtools depth' to do the depth calculation,
    so the samtools package must be installed first.  You can download
    the lastest samtools code from
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/

    'samtools depth' requires that there be a corresponding index file
    for each BAM file.  Use 'samtools index' to make an index file,
    e.g. 'samtools index exp1.bam' which will produce exp1.bam.bai in
    the same directory.

    bam2depth.py takes as its first argument a GTF file that specifies
    chromosomes and regions covered by each feature (we're usually
    taking about genes here, although it could be any type of region
    you like).  If you've been doing bioinforatics for a while you are
    nodoubt familiar with GTF files and may have some lying around
    already.  Unfortunately getting a GTF file is more complicated
    than it should be.  See the instructions on the UCSC genome wiki
    for using genePredToGtf to download annotation files from the UCSC
    web site,
    http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Genes_in_gtf_or_gff_format


Usage scenarios - 

      NB: it is strongly suggested that you first try using
      bam2depth.py with a single gene and a single BAM file.  That
      will give the fastest results while debugging.

      Calculate red depth for a single gene across a single BAM file.
      The named gene must exist in the GTF reference file.
      This is usually much faster than getting the depth across all
      files in the GTF file.

          python bam2depth.py -g ATBC RefSeq.gtf exp1.ba, exp2.bam

      Calculate read depth across all features in RefSeq.gtf for a single BAM file.

          python bam2depth.py RefSeq.gtf exp1.bam >depth.txt

      Calculate read depth across all features in RefSeq.gtf for several BAM files.

          python bam2depth.py RefSeq.gtf exp1.bam exp2.bam exp3.bam >depth.txt

      Calculate read depth for a single gene in RefSeq.gtf for multiple
      BAM files.  

          python bam2depth.py -g ATBC RefSeq.gtf exp1.ba, exp2.bam

      Calculate read depth for multiple genes across multiple BAM files.

          python bam2depth.py -g ATBC,GENE2 RefSeq.gtf exp1.ba, exp2.bam
