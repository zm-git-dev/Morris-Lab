Most recent are at top.
<ul>
  <li>
  Add two buttons for downloading CSV tables of read depth data.  
  </li>
  <li>
  Add a hack to remove any alignments that fall outside the
  transcipt.   There really shouldn't be any of these but there are.
  This hack gets people going again...</li>
  <li>Added a slider below the plot area to narrow the view of the
  plot.  The positioning of this control is certainly not ideal, as I
  would like it to exactly match the width of the plot, however that
  is not currently feasible.  Perhaps the right answer is to go to a
  more interactive charting package like Highcharts or GoogleVis.</li>

  <li>Replaced dropdown list with text box for maximum flexibility.
  This is not the type of control I would like to have here, but it is
  difficult to find a control that will work with Shiny and which can
  by dynamically updated with new content every time a dataset is
  selected.  I tried using Select2 - that seems to handle large
  datasets better - but it is not yet fully integrated with Shiny and
  so cannot be dynamically updated with new content.  I probably want
  a control that is dynamically fed content by an Ajax callback to a
  database, but Shiny doesn't yet support such an interface (and is
  unlikely to ever do so).</li>

  <li>Added navicon (<img src="navicon.svg"/>) with dropdown menu.
  The menu is non-functional right now.</li> </ul>
